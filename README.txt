An AI writing assistant to help authors generate ideas to eliminate writer's block.

== Description ==

**Never have writer’s block again!**

Generate advanced AI powered content ideas to help you write engaging blog posts with ease. WritersBlok uses highly advanced GPT AI machine learning models to improve your writing abilities. This content generator is a powerful tool to have in your writing toolkit. Generate high-quality, longer articles using OpenAI’s GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) and GPT 3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo) language models.

This plugin can assist you in the entire blog post writing lifecycle including the following features:

* **Generate ideas for blog post topics:** Enter a topic or niche that you are interested in and generate a list of possible article titles and article topics to help get you started.
* **Outline blog post structure:** Take your title or keywords and generate an outline of subheadings to structure your blog post. Choose which subheadings to include in your post.
* **Create intros and conclusions:** Easily generate an introduction or conclusion to your blog post that can be reworded as necessary.
* **Transform your keywords into text:** Enter some keywords or subheadings and generate paragraphs of text to help you get started. 
* **Create bullet point ideas:** Use keywords to generate a list of bullet points to expand on.

WriterBlok leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 models, the same models that power ChatGPT. We use a "bring your own key" model. Which means you need to sign up for an API key on [OpenAI API website](https://openai.com/api/) to get started. OpenAI will provide you with sample credits that will give you a good chance to explore the plugin.

GPT-3 is one of the most advanced artificial intelligence systems created to date with several key benefits:

1. GPT-3 is the largest AI language model ever created with 175 billion parameters.
1. GPT-3 can generate human-like text and can be used to create applications such as question answering, text summarization, machine translation, natural language understanding, and more.
1. GPT-3 offers users a no-code platform to create powerful natural language processing models in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches.
1. GPT-3 is designed to learn from the Internet, so its natural language understanding is constantly improving.
1. GPT-3 is available through an API, allowing developers to create AI products in a matter of hours.

AI is being leveraged by every industry and is predicted to have a major impact on almost everything that we interact with daily. Take advantage of this amazing technology to increase your blogging productivity and give your readers insightful content.

The advanced artificial intelligence of WritersBlok AI WordPress plugin is able to understand the human text entered by leveraging advanced Natural Language Understanding. It will process the text entered and respond with high quality and relevant output. This makes it very easy to enhance your content. 

Generate blogging content, product descriptions, and any other content imaginable. It works with every topic or niche you can think of.
